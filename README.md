The more popular and widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm likely to be encountered nowadays is the 
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). It is found at least six time faster than triple DES.

A replacement for DES was needed as its key size was too small. With increasing computing power, it was 
considered vulnerable against exhaustive key search attack. 
Triple DES was designed to overcome this drawback but it was found slow.

The features of AES are as follows −

Symmetric key symmetric block cipher

128-bit data, 128/192/256-bit keys

Stronger and faster than Triple-DES

Software implementable in C and Java

Operation of AES

AES is an iterative rather than Feistel cipher. It is based on ‘substitution–permutation network’. 

It comprises of a series of linked operations, some of which involve replacing inputs by specific outputs (substitutions) 
and others involve shuffling bits around (permutations).
